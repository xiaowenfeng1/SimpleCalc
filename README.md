* user can enter a number; hit return
* user can enter an operation (add, sub, mul, div, mod), then return
* user can enter a number; hit return
* program calculates result

1. "count": count the number of input
    * 10 4 25 17 5 count => 5
2. "average": average all the inputs
    * 2 4 6 8 10 avg => 6
    * the above can take any number of inputs
3. "fact": calculate factorial (can only take one input)
    * 5 fact => 120

##Extra credit
